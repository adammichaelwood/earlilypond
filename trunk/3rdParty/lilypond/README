Notes for this selection of files.

these files set up a system of menus for LilyPond-mode. To install them, put them in a
folder where emacs can find them. For instance in ~/.elisp/site-lisp/LilyPond/ or
whereever you decide to put it.  Then tell emacs where it is by writing in your .emacs
file (eval-after-load "LilyPond-mode" (load-library
"~/Path/to/your/lilypond-skeletons.el"))

To get the most out of the LilyPond info files you need to make sure they are in your info
path. If they are not in a standard place, which often it seems they are not, find where
they are and the write the following.  (setq Info-additional-directory-list (quote
("/path/to/info/dir"))) in your .emacs file.

Some cool things that can help you write your LilyPond files.

Completion
If you are using a word LilyPond-mode knows about eg inbuilt functions, you can
	M-TAB to complete the word.

Dabbrev
If you have already used a word or term you can write the first couple of letters
and them M-/ to complete it. How good would that be instead of writing out
Halleluia ten times in a file? As dabbrev can look in all open buffers, if the
word you're looking for isn't in the current buffer keep M-/ to cycle through the
words that begin with the letters you've written so far.

Evaluating expressions
If I've put an expression in the template like this
(info "(LilyPond) Bagpipe") you can put the cursor just after the last parenthesis
and C-x C-e to evaluate it. Then if you have the LilyPond info files in the
path (see above) the page in the LilyPond info to do with bagpipes will
open up in the other buffer for your perusal.

Customizing this library

If you don't want to have all the templates available, if you are only interested in the
piano templates, say, you can M-x customize-group LilyPond to find the variables for
turning off the various menus. Just put nil for the set of templates you are not
interested in and the menus for them will disappear. The variables have names like
LilyPond-vocal-templates-p. All of the templates are available by default.
